# HTTPRouter using a Trie
## How to solve it?
### - Building a Router class with root handler and not found handler
### - create function insert in RouteTrieNod




# Time complexities and space complexities of RouteTrie to insert = O(n)
# Time complexities and space complexities of RouteTrie to find = O(n)

# Time complexities and space complexities of RouteTrieNode to insert = O(n)

# Time complexities and space complexities of Router to insert = O(n)
# Time complexities and space complexities of Router to find = O(n)
