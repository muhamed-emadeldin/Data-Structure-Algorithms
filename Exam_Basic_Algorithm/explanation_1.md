# Finding the Square Root of an Integer
## How to solve it?
### - first of all I used concept of binary search algorithm
### - Create a base caces for numbers(0, 1)
### - first of all I used concept of binary search algorithm
### - Create a two variables Start "which value= 2 because we have 0 and 1 in base cases" and end "which value= of number - 1
### - create a function called binary search with 3 arguments (target, start, end)


# Time complexities in worst case: O(log(n))
### function sqrt(number) = O(log(n))
### function binary_search(target, start, end) = O(log(n))
### all variables = O(1)

# Space complexities in worst case: O(n)
### sqrt(number) in worst case: O(n)
### binary_search(target, start, end) in worst case: O(n)
### all variables in worst case: O(1)
