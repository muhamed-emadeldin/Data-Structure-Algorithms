# Building a Trie in Python
## How to solve it?
### - Bulding a simple Trie with Trie class, TrieNode clas
### - add 3 functions insert in TrieNode class (insert, suffixes, autocomplete)
### - make a loop with original list and put 2 condations: if int = 0, int = 2
### - after loop convert only None item in new list to 1 via value of start and end


# Time complexities and space complexities of TrieNode to insert = O(n)
# Time complexities and space complexities of TrieNode to suffix = O(n)

# Time complexities and space complexities of Trie to insert = O(n)
# Time complexities and space complexities of Trie to find = O(n)
