# Why I did use that data structure?
### -Create a class Node to recod characters and frequencies
### -import heapq to take min frequencies of nodes
### -Create a class Queue to print Huffman Tree
### -Create a class Tree to Huffman coding

# Time complexities: O(nlogn)
### class node O(n)
### class Queue O(n)
### class heapq O(logn)
### class Huffman Tree O(logn)

## Note I did try to solve this problem but I can't solve with a right way
